  # darkpeter.nvim
  A customized fork of OneDark.nvim, optimized for high-contrast readability.

  Original work by [Navarasu](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim).

    At this point this is an outright clone of navarasu onedark.

    I've noticed that at my age there are very very few colorschemes I can actually use.
    This is because of advancing age colorblindness and cataracts.  

    Besides I'm an actual doctor optometry who prefers coding than giving eye exams.
    (well that's not entirely true).

    I will not include a light theme because all light themes cause too much glare.
    Hopefully there are some Dead Head coder grey beards out there who will enjoy my theme.
    **Dark** **HIGH CONTRAST Themes** for neovim >= 0.5 based on onedark
 
### Features
  * 3 theme styles 
  * Supporting multiple plugins with hand picked proper colors
  * Customize `Colors`, `Highlights` and `Code style` of the theme as you like (Refer [Customization](#customization))
  * Toggle the theme style without exiting Neovim using `toggle_style_key` (Refer [Config](#default-configuration))

INSTALLATION:

You'll figure it out.
