Free as in Beer usage. However at my age I prefer other drugs of choice.  Like Metformin or an occasional valium.

Drug laws in the US are stupid and will continue to be stupid as long as there is big money behind the
villification of even the mildest of drugs.  Gotta keep little Jimmy out of the medicine cabinet because 
he's liable to drink all the drano and aspirin and maybe some gasoline as a chaser.  

But beer and cigarettes are freely available everywhere. Gotta wonder.

At 63 a six of beer is now a 3 day hangover. Is that what you want?
